#PART 1

#Lists are mutable (means changeable), they store objects in an order and can be mixed with different values
#Tuples are immutable (means unchangeable), once your enter the data the items and order cannot be changed
#Indexing is listing or making the data into a specific order
#The difference between lists and tuples in pythonn are that lists are mutable and tuples are not
#In lists, indexing is creating a specific placement or order for the items

#PART 2

#If you try to modify an element it will show an error


#In Python, lists and tuples are both very useful data structures.
#Lists have mutability, making them better for codes that are more flexiable
#and dynamic. Tuples are immutable, making them ideal for fixed data where the
#elements do not change. Choosing between lists and tuples depends on the
#requirements for your code which includes wether your code should be modified
#or wether the code is being stored.
